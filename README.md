# Jim's Angular Testing Workshops

Having Unit Tests and E2e Tests when you finish development and it's "hands off" time makes your code substantially more solid. Having passing tests will give you a confidence about your code that you could never otherwise have! :)

The problem is that writing them requires getting into a habit of reasoning in a certain way, and getting familiar with the syntax. These examples are meant to be a gentle introduction to the right way of writing unit and e2e tests. The examples are meant to be working projects with empty tests suites, and you need to fill them in with as many unique tests as you can think of. Try to break the application with the tests, and then start modifying the application code to get the tests passing.



## Gulp-Angular
All of the Angular 1 examples use a project scaffolded from the Gulp-Angular Yeoman generator.  

## Where to Start
TDD (test driven development)
